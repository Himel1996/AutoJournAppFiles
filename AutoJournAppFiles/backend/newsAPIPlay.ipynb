       "[('Key Rates Move Higher for Homebuyers: Mortgage Interest Rates Today for July 22, 2025',\n",
       "  'Check out CNET Money\\'s weekly mortgage rate forecast for a more in-depth look at what’s next for Fed rate cuts, labor data and inflation.\\n\\nThe average for a 30-year fixed mortgage is 6.85% today, an increase of 0.05% since one week ago. The average rate for a 15-year fixed mortgage is 6.07%, which is an increase of 0.07% compared to a week ago. You could get a lower mortgage interest rate by making a higher down payment, improving your credit score or buying mortgage points.\\n\\nWhat’s keeping mortgage rates elevated this year? Concerns about persistent inflation, threats of a global trade war and policy turbulence have created an uncertain economic outlook. In response, the Federal Reserve has adopted a wait-and-see approach and kept interest rates steady in 2025.\\n\\nFinancial markets largely expect the Fed to resume lowering rates in September, particularly if President Trump eases some of his aggressive tariff measures or if the labor market continues to deteriorate.\\n\\nProspective homebuyers shouldn’t expect mortgage rates to become affordable overnight. While cheaper borrowing costs gradually trickle down to the housing market, the Fed doesn’t directly set lenders\\' mortgage rates.\\n\\nIn today’s unaffordable housing market, mortgage rates are just one piece of the puzzle. Prospective buyers still have to contend with high home prices and skyrocketing homeownership expenses. The possibility of a job-loss recession is also pushing many households to tighten their budgets and take on less financial risk.\\n\\nWhen mortgage rates start to fall, be ready to take advantage. Experts recommend shopping around and comparing multiple offers to get the lowest rate. Enter your information here to get a custom quote from one of CNET\\'s partner lenders.\\n\\nAbout these rates: Bankrate\\'s tool features rates from partner lenders that you can use when comparing multiple mortgage rates.\\n\\nWhat\\'s behind today\\'s high mortgage rates?\\n\\nMortgage rates have remained elevated, volleying between 6.5% and 7% for the past several months.\\n\\nMortgage rates primarily take their cues from the 10-year Treasury yield, which reflects investors\\' collective expectations regarding inflation, labor market health, upcoming monetary policy shifts and the impact of global factors like tariffs. If investors anticipate persistently high inflation or significant government borrowing, they\\'ll demand higher returns on their bonds, which in turn keeps mortgage rates elevated.\\n\\n\"Rates could fall if inflation keeps cooling and the labor market softens,\" said Jeb Smith, licensed real estate agent and member of CNET Money\\'s expert review board. \"On the other hand, tariffs could create new inflation pressure. Add in government deficits and increased bond supply, and that puts upward pressure on rates.\"\\n\\nEven as the Fed eventually starts to reduce borrowing rates, experts warn of a lot more volatility in the market. As a result, homebuyers are being more patient and strategic about financing, comparing different loan types and planning ahead.\\n\\n\"Some are waiting, others are getting pre-approved now so they’re ready to act if rates fall,\" said Smith.\\n\\nFor a look at mortgage rate movement in recent years, see the chart below.\\n\\nMortgage predictions for 2025\\n\\nDespite hopes that 2025 would bring relief to the housing market, economic and political instability have kept it stuck in neutral. Median family income has not kept pace with the surge in housing costs, requiring many households to earn double or triple their salary to afford a modest home in some cities.\\n\\nMortgage rates would have to take a big step down, close to 6% or below, to drum up significant homebuying demand. According to Smith, though, the more likely scenario is a slow and steady decline in borrowing costs. A return to the record-low rates, around 2-3%, we saw during the pandemic would only happen if the economy tipped into a severe recession.\\n\\nFannie Mae now predicts rates around 6.5% by the end of 2025 and 6.1% by the end of 2026.\\n\\nNumerous risks could keep rates elevated. For instance, if tariffs cause inflation to reignite, which most experts and Fed officials expect, it could result in higher bond yields and fewer interest rate cuts by the central bank. Both would be bad for mortgage rates.\\n\\nWhat is a good mortgage type and term?\\n\\nEach mortgage has a loan term, or payment schedule. The most common mortgage terms are 15 and 30 years, although 10-, 20- and 40-year mortgages also exist. With a fixed-rate mortgage, the interest rate is set for the duration of the loan, offering stability. With an adjustable-rate mortgage, the interest rate is only fixed for a certain amount of time (commonly five, seven or 10 years), after which the rate adjusts annually based on the market. Fixed-rate mortgages are a better option if you plan to live in a home in the long term, but adjustable-rate mortgages may offer lower interest rates upfront.\\n\\n30-year fixed-rate mortgages\\n\\nThe average 30-year fixed mortgage interest rate is 6.85% today. A 30-year fixed mortgage is the most common loan term. It will often have a higher interest rate than a 15-year mortgage, but you’ll have a lower monthly payment.\\n\\n15-year fixed-rate mortgages\\n\\nToday, the average rate for a 15-year, fixed mortgage is 6.07%. Though you’ll have a bigger monthly payment than a 30-year fixed mortgage, a 15-year loan usually comes with a lower interest rate, allowing you to pay less interest in the long run and pay off your mortgage sooner.\\n\\n5/1 adjustable-rate mortgages\\n\\nA 5/1 adjustable-rate mortgage has an average rate of 6.03% today. You’ll typically get a lower introductory interest rate with a 5/1 ARM in the first five years of the mortgage. But you could pay more after that period, depending on how the rate adjusts annually. If you plan to sell or refinance your house within five years, an ARM could be a good option.\\n\\nCalculate your monthly mortgage payment\\n\\nGetting a mortgage should always depend on your financial situation and long-term goals. The most important thing is to make a budget and try to stay within your means. CNET\\'s mortgage calculator below can help homebuyers prepare for monthly mortgage payments.\\n\\nWhat are some tips for finding the best mortgage rates?\\n\\nThough mortgage rates and home prices are high, the housing market won’t be unaffordable forever. It’s always a good time to save for a down payment and improve your credit score to help you secure a competitive mortgage rate when the time is right.'),\n",

With the impending deadline for the 90 day pause fast approaching, the question is what deals the US can negotiate and what level of tariffs will be agreed.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the first 100 days of his second presidency, Donald Trump blew up eight decades of global trade rules with the imposition of a 10% global baseline and a \"reciprocal\" tariff framework, plus sizeable tariffs on strategic sectors. These measures have disrupted global supply chains and created significant uncertainty for businesses across the world, while also impacting consumer sentiment (which recently fell to a five-year low in the US). The focus on the coming months will be on which trade deals the US government is able to negotiate and at what level tariffs will settle in the medium term.\\n\\n\\n\\nKey Highlights\\n\\nWith the impending deadline for the 90 day pause fast approaching, the question is what deals the US can negotiate and what level of tariffs will be agreed. Even then, the tariff wars will change trade flows and lead to a further restructuring of supply chains. The reality is we are heading towards a more fractured world, and lower growth and higher inflation may result.\\n\\nScope\\n\\nThis report outlines the impact of tariffs on the global economy and key industries.\\n\\nIt includes analysis of the macroeconomic implications and outlines how this theme could play out over the coming weeks and months.\\n\\nDetailed insights are provided into the impact of tariffs in 15 sectors: aerospace, defense, and security, agribusiness, automotive, construction, consumer, financial services, medical devices, mining, oil and gas, pharma, power, retail, sport, technology, and travel and tourism.\\n\\nThe report also includes our sector scorecards, which have been updated as appropriate to capture the impact of the emerging trade war.\\n\\nReasons to Buy\\n\\nAll sectors are impacted by higher tariffs and the prospect of a global trade war, whether directly (such as by Trump\\'s baseline global 10% tariff) or indirectly by the impact on the wider economy. Understand the impact on your business with the analyst\\'s executive briefing, which includes analysis from our industry analysts and macroeconomic experts.\\n\\nKey Topics Covered:\\n\\nExecutive Summary\\n\\nTariffs: Macro Impact and Scenarios\\n\\nTariff Tracker and Country Impact\\n\\nCountry, Sector, and FX Indices\\n\\nMedia Insights\\n\\nSector Analysis\\n\\nAppendix: the analyst Strategic Intelligence\\n\\nFor more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/y3lvfu\\n\\nAbout ResearchAndMarkets.com\\n\\nResearchAndMarkets.com is the world\\'s leading source for international market research reports and market data.

       "  'The prospect of Canada reaching a trade deal with the United States by the Aug. 1 deadline appears uncertain, with Prime Minister Mark Carney insisting his government will only sign a new agreement if there is one worth signing.\\n\\n\"The Government of Canada will not accept a bad deal,\" Carney said in French in Huntsville, Ont., Tuesday. \"Our objective is not to reach a deal whatever it costs. We are pursuing a deal that will be in the best interest of Canadians.\"\\n\\nWhen it comes to the prospect of reaching a deal, Carney said \"we\\'ll see\" and that \"complex negotiations\" continue. He said if there isn\\'t a deal that works for Canada, his government will \"take stock\" and consider what to do next.\\n\\nThe prime minister made the remarks after dropping into the first ministers\\' meeting in Ontario\\'s cottage country, where he briefed Canada\\'s premiers on the government\\'s trade discussions with the Trump administration.\\n\\nOntario Premier Doug Ford is hosting the premiers for three days of meetings to discuss their own response to the trade war U.S. President Donald Trump launched against Canada.\\n\\nWATCH | Carney says work still being done on U.S. trade deal: Carney says \\'we’re working to get the best deal\\' with U.S. Prime Minister Mark Carney, speaking to reporters in Huntsville, Ont., on Tuesday, says he is working with the premiers to \\'build up\\' Canada while negotiations continue with the U.S.\\n\\nCarney said that a good deal would reinforce the country\\'s long-standing and successful trading relationship with the U.S. while not preventing Canada from expanding the country\\'s relationships around the world.\\n\\n\"Our phone is ringing off the hook from other countries that want to do more with Canada,\" Carney said. \"I\\'ve had over 80 bilaterals with world leaders since I became prime minister. A number of the premiers have been on major trade missions. We have other things to do,\" he said.\\n\\nNova Scotia Premier Tim Houston said after meeting with Carney that he isn\\'t dead set on signing a deal by the deadline — he wants the best deal for Canada regardless of how long it takes.\\n\\nHouston said he still hopes that is possible and has \"tremendous confidence in the prime minister and the team that is representing us as Canadians.\"\\n\\nWATCH | N.S. premier says meeting Aug. 1 deadline isn\\'t his focus: N.S. premier says he’s not \\'focused on the date\\' of U.S. trade deadline Nova Scotia Premier Tim Houston said Tuesday that it’s \\'really important for us to get the best deal for Canadians,\\' and that he\\'s \\'confident\\' in the abilities of the prime minister.\\n\\nQuebec Premier François Legault said it is \"very difficult\" to say whether there will be a trade deal with the U.S. by Aug. 1.\\n\\n\"We would like to have the ideal deal,\" Legault said, \"but what can we get? You almost need to ask Donald Trump and I\\'m not even sure that he knows himself what he wants.\"\\n\\nFord said he still thinks a deal is \"realistic\" but Canada has to \"focus on what\\'s going to strengthen\" the economy rather than what Trump will do next.\\n\\nNew Brunswick Premier Susan Holt said she, too, is focused on getting a good deal, not a fast deal.\\n\\n\"I think that\\'s the realization that we\\'ve come to in seeing how things have moved with other countries,\" she said.\\n\\nWATCH | Holt on the Aug. 1 deadline: ‘We want a good deal, not a fast deal,\\' says N.B. premier New Brunswick Premier Susan Holt said on Tuesday that the premiers \\'encouraged the prime minister to not make a deal at all costs\\' as the Aug. 1 deadline to reach a trade agreement with the U.S. nears.\\n\\nCarney arrived in Muskoka on Monday evening to have dinner with the premiers at Ford\\'s cottage, after spending the day hosting a bipartisan delegation of U.S. senators in Ottawa.\\n\\nBefore he went into his meeting with the premiers, Carney said Canada\\'s economic response to Trump\\'s tariffs so far is built on two tracks: supporting affected industries, such as lumber, steel, auto manufacturing and aluminum production; and ensuring Canada\\'s economy grows by breaking down internal trade barriers and quickly approving major projects.\\n\\nApproving projects like ports, pipelines and mines will be easier now that Bill C-5, or the One Canadian Economy Act, has become law.\\n\\nCarney said his new federal projects office will be open by Labour Day, which he said will provide a single point of contact for provinces, companies and communities looking to get major nation-building projects approved.\\n\\nEnsuring energy security\\n\\nFord, Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe and Alberta Premier Danielle Smith signed a memorandum of understanding on Tuesday morning to build new energy and trade infrastructure. Manitoba did not sign the agreement, with Premier Wab Kinew saying his province\\'s major infrastructure projects must first have a consensus from Indigenous stakeholders before putting shovels in the ground.\\n\\nCBC News asked the premiers if Canada needs to replace Line 5 — the more than 1,000-kilometre-long pipeline carrying 540,000 barrels of oil and natural gas liquids daily across Wisconsin and Michigan to refineries in Sarnia, Ont. — regardless of whether there is a private-sector proponent behind such a plan.\\n\\n\"I believe so,\" Ford said. \"We can\\'t rely on the Americans anymore. Simple as that.\"\\n\\nOntario Premier Doug Ford and Quebec Premier François Legault both said that the terms of a U.S. trade deal were still unclear due to the unpredictable president. (Toni Choueiri/CBC News)\\n\\nMoe said Canada does not want to find itself in the same position as Europe, which recently found out what it means to be heavily reliant on oil and gas from Russia.\\n\\n\"We certainly need to have a very mature discussion about how we can provide Western Canadian oil and gas to Canadians that live in Central and Eastern Canada for our own good,\" Moe said. \"Not only our economic security but our energy security.\"\\n\\nSmith said building a pipeline entirely within Canada is \"probably something that is long overdue. We probably should have done it decades ago.\"')]"
